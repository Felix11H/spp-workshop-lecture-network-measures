## About

Lecture on network measures (tools, visualization, density, in- and out-degress, clustering, shortest paths, modularity) prepared for "Understanding the Structure of Brain Networks" workshop in 2018.

The lecture is written as an interactive [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) extension to generate reveal.js slideshows.
